            <h2 id="taraHead">Tarangire national park</h2>
            <p id="taraTxt">Tarangire is one of the more seasonal parks in northern Tanzania, with a lot of migratory <br>movement within the greater Tarangire ecosystem. In the Dry season, between June and <br>October, large herds of animals are attracted to the Tarangire River. At this time, the elephant <br>numbers are spectacular and the park should be <br>part of any safari in northern Tanzania.</p>

            <h2 id="taraHead">Serengeti national park</h2>
            <p id="taraTxt">The Serengeti is one of the most famous parks in Africa and is synonymous with wildlife <br> and classic African scenery. It is Tanzania's oldest park and a Unesco World Heritage<br> Site. It is home to the spectacular wildebeest migration and offers top-class wildlife viewing<br> throughout the year.</p>

            <h2 id="taraHead">Ngorongoro Crater</h2>
            <p id="taraTxt">A visit to the Ngorongoro Crater is an experience of a lifetime. There are few places that have wildlife densities <br>and variety on this level. It is not unusual to see the Big Five in one day (African Lion, African Elephant,<br> African Leopard, African Buffalo, Rhinoceros (Black or White))and all this in the most amazing setting with a <br>backdrop of the 600m/1,968ft-high crater wall.</p>
